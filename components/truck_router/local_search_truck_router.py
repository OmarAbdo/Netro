"""
LocalSearchTruckRouter Module
-------------------------------
This module implements a local search heuristic to improve a CVRP solution
for truck routing. It includes multiple operators:
    1. Intra-route 2-opt: Optimize a single route by reordering stops.
    2. Inter-route Swap: Swap nodes between routes if capacity constraints allow.
    3. Route Merge: Merge two routes if their combined demand is under capacity and distance is reduced.
    
The algorithm iteratively applies these operators to the initial CVRP solution (obtained via TruckRouter)
until no further improvements are observed or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
