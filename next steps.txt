Now that I have a baseline solver, I just need it to print more benchmark data. so for example how much time and cost were needed for such deliveries 
and how much Co2 were produced as a result of using the vehicles.

-------------------------------


Next command for O1

Can you make me a 3rd script that will get the solution from a TruckDeliveryBaseline instance and run your suggested verification of the solution (points 2.a Route Validity, 2.2 Capacity Constraints,  to 2.d) as well as points suggested for enhancing the solver? visualization, saving results to a file, and using a different numbers of trucks?

optionally we can also optimize the solver params and have a gurobi implementation.

point 3.c from O1

c. Optimizing Solver Parameters
Experimenting with different solver parameters can lead to better solutions or faster computation times.

Suggestions:

First Solution Strategy: Try different strategies like SAVINGS, SWEEP, PATH_MOST_CONSTRAINED_ARC, etc.
Local Search Metaheuristic: Explore other metaheuristics like TABU_SEARCH, SIMULATED_ANNEALING, etc.
Time Limit: Adjust the time_limit based on the problem size and required solution quality.
